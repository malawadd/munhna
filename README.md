## Introduction 

 Presenting a Revolutionary Dapp that Transforms Flexibility, Empowers Dynamic Functionality, and Simplifies Effortless Token Management, all within a Single Platform!

## Key Features

Key Features of Beam :

1. **Customizable Token Economics:** Munhna provides users with the capability to tailor token economics by adjusting bonding curve parameters, including initial price, slope, and reserve ratio, to align precisely with their preferred token issuance strategies.

2. **Support for different types of bonding curves:** Munhna provide a range of bonding curve options, allowing token issuers to select the curve type aligning with their specific tokenomics and project needs. This flexibility empowers token issuers to customize token issuance dynamics in accordance with their unique objectives.


3. **Token-Vesting:** Throughout the lock-up duration, users have the option to unlock potential benefits linked to token appreciation. Those who choose to lock their tokens can seize the opportunity to sell at a higher rate once the lock-up period concludes, potentially facilitating profit generation as the token's value increases..

4. **Efficient Price Discovery:** The price of the token is determined by the bonding curve algorithm based on the ratio of tokens in circulation. This allows traders to accurately assess the token's current value, enhancing transparency and enabling more informed trading decisions.



## Usage
the possibilities are endless. Users can effortlessly beaaam tokens to any  address, ensuring a smooth and continuous flow of funds. Whether it's distributing earnings to contributors, setting up vesting schedules, or offering subscription-based services, Ktrh's dynamic features cater to diverse business models.

## Local deployment

1. in the webapp directory run yarn to procced with installing all the packages

    ```bash
    yarn 
    ```

2. fill the env variables required in **.env.example** file. 
3. run the local dev app

    ```bash
    yarn start 
    ```

## Munhna bounding curves

**Bonding curves** are mathematical functions that establish a relationship between the price of a token and its supply. They play a crucial role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and token economics by providing a mechanism for determining token prices based on supply and demand dynamics. Different types of bonding curves, such as linear, polynomial, sub-linear, and S-curve, offer unique price dynamics and serve specific purposes.


One of the key benefits of bonding curves is that they enable token issuance and investment without the need for collateral. Users can purchase tokens directly from the curve, and the price dynamically adjusts based on the token's supply. This eliminates the requirement for external liquidity sources and centralized exchanges, facilitating continuous trading and liquidity provision. Additionally, bonding curves provide an opportunity to pump the value of tokens as demand increases. By attracting more buyers, the price of the tokens can rise, creating profit potential for early adopters.

### Linear Curve
Experience the straightforward elegance of our Linear Bonding Curve, where the token price rises or falls in a linear fashion as the token supply increases or decreases. With a simple formula in play, you can rely on a pricing mechanism that offers transparency and predictability, keeping your project on a stable and consistent path.

### Polynomial Curve
Unlock the power of the Polynomial Curve, where token pricing takes on a captivating curved path driven by a versatile formula. With the Polynomial Curve, your token's value can experience exponential growth, controlled fluctuations, or tailored trajectories based on the values assigned to the coefficients (a, b, c, d) and powers (n) in the formula. This flexibility enables you to create unique token economics that aligns with your project's vision.
